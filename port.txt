--> A port is a device.
--> to receive the bytes from external peripherals for reading them later using instructions executed on the processor.
--> To Send the bytes to external peripherals or devices or processors using instructions executed on a processor.

-->I/O port types
1. Serial input-output ports
2. Parallel input-output ports

=> Serial I/O ports
1. Synchronous Serial Input
2. Synchronous Serial Output
3. Asynchronous Serial UART Input
4. Asynchronous Serial UART Output
5. Both as input and as output, for example, modem.

=> Parallel I/O ports
1. Parallel port one-bit Input
2. Parallel one-bit output
3. Parallel Port multi-bit Input
4. Parallel Port multi-bit Output

Notes:

--> Commonly used input peripherals in embedded systems are:
1. Push button keys
2. Dip switches
3. Keyboard
4. Mouse
5. touchscreen

Output Devices are:
1. LCD screen
2. Printers
3. PCs

---> GPIO ports of different microcontrollers have 16 I/O pins for each port.
---> 8051-based microcontroller supports 8 I/O pins.

==> If we take a pic microcontroller it has

 five input-output ports which are:
1. Port A
2. Port B
3. Port C
4. Port D
5. Port E

=> Pin of ports
1. Port A --> 7 pins
2. Port B --> 8 pins
3. Port C --> 8 pins
4. Port D --> 8 pins
5. Port E --> 3 pins
