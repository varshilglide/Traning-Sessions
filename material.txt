4. To enable and disable bit in registers https://blog.feabhas.com/2019/01/peripheral-register-access-using-c-structs-part-1/ 
5. stm32 registers  https://controllerstech.com/stm32-gpio-output-config-using-registers/ 
6. Pin-muxing in the controller:  Same pin shared by gpio, i2c-scl, uart-tx, and so on. We need to define only the peripheral that is needed. 
7. HW: What is a port in stm32? how many ports are there and how to access another gpio except user-led and user switch on a different PORT and pin?
