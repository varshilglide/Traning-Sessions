Q: What is MicroController?
--> A MicroController is a VLSI IC that contains a CPU(Processor) along with some other peripherals like memory, I/O Ports, Timers/Counters, Communication Interface, ADC, etc.

Q: What is MicroProcessor?
--> A MicroProcessor is just a Processor (CPU) and doesn't have the above-mentioned peripherals. 
--> In order to make it work or build a system around it, we need to interface the peripherals separately.


Q: 8051 MicroController?
--> 8051 Microcontrollers were developed using N-MOS Technology but the use of battery-powered devices and their low power consumption lead to the usage of CMOS Technology.
