--> A Memory module is a physical device that is used to store programs or data on a temporary or permanent basis for use in digital electronics.

--> The following general types of the memory module can be used in an embedded system.

Volatile Memory
Non-Volatile Memory

--> Volatile memory devices are types of storage devices that hold their content till power is applied to them.

When power is switched off, these memories lose their content.

--> An example of a volatile memory device is Random Access Memory (RAM)



--> Non-volatile memories are permanent storage types of memory chips that can get back stored information even when the power is switched off. An example of a non-volatile memory device is Read Only Memory (ROM).
